# mt63_wasm

This is very much a work in progress; the idea is to compile a mt63 library to wasm
using emscripten to allow encoding MT63 messages and "sending" them from an HTML5 audio
web application; this could be used to reliably transmit data from a smartphone app
across Amateur Radio FM signals on VHF/UHF.
